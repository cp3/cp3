Concurrent Win:1,3,4,or 5 points If both players “win” on one player’s move on a non-full
board then the player with the most total win points is
awarded the win with the points they receive being the
points from their maximal win. If both players have same
number of total win points from their “wins” then both
players will receive 1 point and the game will be declared
a tie. For example, if red has a 5 point win and blue has
two 3 point wins, then blue is awarded the win since their
total win points is 6 which is greater than red’s total win
points of 5, and blue is awarded their maximal win, which
is 3 points, for the win.If both blue and red had one 5 point
win each then the game would be a tie and both players
would be awarded one point.
Full-Board Tie: 1 point
Loss:
0 points
Default:
5 points
Each player gets 1 point if the tie results from a full board.
The losing player received 0 points.
In the case of a default (max. move time exceeded, illegal
move, etc.) the non-defaulting player will receive a 5
point win.
Game Time Out 5 points
If the 20 minute maximum game time is exceeded then a 5
point win is awarded to the player who consumed the min-
imum time during the game
